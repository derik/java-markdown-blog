# Java Markdown Blog

## About

Java Markdown Blog is a simple blogging platform with [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) support. It's been made just to show the full-stack development possibilities with Java, even though it also makes use of some vanilla JavaScript for a better user experience.

I plan to create a series of blog posts on [my personal blog](https://deriklima.com) explaining how this project was made.
